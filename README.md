# almaty-region-rivers

![](almaty-region-3d-elevation-rivers-2.png)

I have compiled a 3D map of the rivers, taking into account the relief of the Almaty region ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ 

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: terra, elevator, sf, geodata, tidyverse, rayshader, dplyr

The visualization shows the rivers and the relief of the Almaty and Dzhetysui regions

This visualization can be used for:

- Analysis of watersheds and hydrological processes.
- Designing infrastructure, including roads and water supply.
- Identification of flood zones and management of water resources.
- Teaching geography and ecology.
- Planning outdoor activities such as fishing and kayaking.
